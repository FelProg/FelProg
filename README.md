### Hi there 👋

-Welcome to my personal github 🥷... This is mostly about testing programming excercises from school 🍎 or tutorials around the internet 👓.
-People I know consider me better at frontend technologies, however, I am thriving to  be a fullstack developer 🦾... Not an easy task if you want to be one of the good ones.
-My goal is to have javascript in the frontend with React and .NET on the back. But I am not against any programming language nor technology. If you have any advices, I will love to hear about them... Thank you!! 🤝

Thumbs up 👍 to Universidad Kino, 👍 Universidad Tecnológica de Hermosillo and 👍 Instituto Tecnológico de Hermosillo... All of them educational institutions that build the knowledge I currently have... Thank you Freecodecamp, Udemy, Youtube, Scrimba, Coursera and many more for everything you have thought me too ❤️...

Alright, Thats all on my side... In case you've went through all the info, thank you for taking the time and good luck also on your journey 🐸.
